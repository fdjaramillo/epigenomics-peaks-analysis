## Overview
This [report](https://github.com/fdjaramillo/epigenomics-peaks-analysis/wiki) provides the commands used to analyze regulatory elements in stomach and sigmoid colon samples from a donor in the EN-TEx project. The analysis focuses on identifying open chromatin regions (ATAC-seq peaks), their overlap with histone modification marks (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac), and linking these regions to their closest genes. The provided code extends and addresses sections 4 and 5 of this [hands-on](https://github.com/bborsari/epigenomics_uvic/wiki/2.-ChIP%E2%80%90seq-processing-and-analysis).
